            Artificial Intelligence or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues
            to be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, 
            work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech
            recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.
            The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems
            reaching over $57 billion in 2022.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development,
            programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few.Machine Learning,the subset of AI, is also being deployed 
            in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals

                Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain
                offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data
                you can only add to, not take away from, or change. Hence the term “chain” because you are making a chain of data.
                Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven,
                so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you do not need a trusted third-party to oversee or 
                validate transactions.
                Several industries are involving and implementing blockchain, and as the use of blockchain technology increases,
                so too does the demand for skilled professionals. From a birds eye view, a blockchain developer specializes in 
                developing and implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology. The average yearly salary of
                 a blockchain developer is ₹469K.

                Formerly a new technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services),
                Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and
                more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it is no longer the emerging technology trend. Edge is.
                As the quantity of data organizations is dealing with continues to increase, they have realized the shortcomings of cloud 
                computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency
                caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data center for processing. It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, closer 
                to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote 
                locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini 
                datacenters.               
                Edge computing will increase as use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. By 2022, the global edge computing
                market is expected to reach $6.72 billion. And this new technology trend is only meant to grow and nothing less, creating
                various jobs, primarily for software engineers.

              <p class = "item-text">
                Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. 
                RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions,
                dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. 
                Although Forrester Research estimates RPA automation will threaten the livelihood of 230 million or more knowledge 
                workers or approximately 9 percent of the global workforce, RPA is also creating new jobs while altering existing jobs.
                McKinsey finds that less than 5 percent of occupations can be totally automated, but about 60 percent can be partially automated.
                For you as an IT professional looking to the future and trying to understand latest technology trends, RPA offers plenty of 
                career opportunities, including developer, project manager, business analyst, solution architect and consultant. 
                And these jobs pay well. An RPA developer can earn over ₹534K per year - making it the next technology trend you must
                keep a watch on!
              <p class = "item-text"> Mastering RPA will help you secure high paying jobs like:</p>
              <ul class = "item-text">
                <li>RPA Developer</li>
                <li>RPA Analyst</li>

                <div class = "paragraph-break"> </div>
                <p class = "item-text">
                    Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum
                    phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing
                    the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor,
                    analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications is
                    banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.
                    Quantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk, Honeywell, Microsoft,
                    AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of Quantum Computing. 
                    The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass $2.5 billion by 2029.
                    And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, 
                    probability, information theory, and machine learning.
